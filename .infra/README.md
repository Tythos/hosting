This subfolder contains the means to spin up a VM appropriately configured to host the top-level service orchestration. This is done by a combination of DigitalOcean provider/API resources. The full list of required resources includes the following:

- [x] Domain (A record)

- [x] VM ("Droplet")

- [x] A "Mount" (mapping volume to VM)

- [ ] Project

- [x] SSH Key

- [x] Volume

We assume a domain has been registered and is pointing to DigitalOcean nameservers.

The VM is primarily configured via `cloud-init`, whose specification is defined in `user_data.yml.tpl`.

The SSH key is derived from the TLS record generated by Terraform's built-in `tls_private_key` resource.

All inputs are documented in `variables.tf`; these can be passed via `terraform.tfvars` file contents (git-ignored) or via environmental variable by way of the `TF_VAR_` prefix.
